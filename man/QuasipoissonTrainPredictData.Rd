\usage{
QuasipoissonTrainPredictData(datasetTrain, datasetPredict, reweights = 1,
  remove.pandemic.year = F, remove.highcounts = 0, sign.level = 0.05,
  isDaily = TRUE, v = 1, weeklyDenominatorFunction = sum,
  denominator_string = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{datasetTrain}{Training data.table}

\item{datasetPredict}{Prediction data.table}

\item{reweights}{Number (greater or equal to 0) of residual reweights adjusting for previous outbreaks (default: 1; 1 reweight)}

\item{remove.pandemic.year}{true/false (default: false; keep 2009 data)}

\item{remove.highcounts}{Number between 0 and 1 of fraction of high counts to be removed from prediction, to remove impact of earlier outbreaks (default: 0)}

\item{sign.level}{Significance level for the prediction intervals (default: 0.05)}

\item{isDaily}{Is it daily data or weekly data?}

\item{v}{Version (Not in use)}

\item{weeklyDenominatorFunction}{sum or mean - should the denominator be summed or meaned over time}

\item{denominator_string}{If not NULL then denominator variable is made from this}

\description{
This is the core algorithm of sykdomspulsen.

\details{
Description: Applys a surveillance algorithm based on a quasi-poisson regression
model to the selected data. The difference from the Farrington algorithm is in how
seasonality is accounted for (here it is adjusted for, in Farrington it is removed
by design.
